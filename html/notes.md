For flexbox

Use rem instead of px for font-size on text.

Recreate the html and css template

Position: relative is dependant on where it is originally located

Position: absolute is dependant on its parent

IDEA: 
Create a gif of every card and run the video when hovered over. Otherwise display a static image.

Custom CSS file must come after the bootstrap lines

To override bootstrap, use an ID to reference it and then override it with a descendant, etc...
for ex. (#navvv a{
  margin-right: 40px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
})

For the cards, if the user is on mobile, display a carousel instead of a vertical down which would take up too much space
and also see if you can make the cards appear when scrolling down

For subjects, create a scroll down with all the subjects on the left side and the selected subject appear on the right

Depending on the website, it may be imperative to ask for linking permissions.

Create a button in the footer for the help section ("submit a resource") and link it to another page.

And maybe make the feature image sub header have only apple emojis on both mac and windows (using img?)

For subjects page, make side art something similar to the images on the side of Khan Academy courses dropdown.
