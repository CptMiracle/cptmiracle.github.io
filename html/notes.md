For flexbox

Use rem instead of px for font-size on text.

Recreate the html and css template

Position: relative is dependant on where it is originally located

Position: absolute is dependant on its parent

IDEA: 
Create a gif of every card and run the video when hovered over. Otherwise display a static image.

Custom CSS file must come after the bootstrap lines

To override bootstrap, use an ID to reference it and then override it with a descendant, etc...
for ex. (#navvv a{
  margin-right: 40px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
})

For the cards, if it is mobile, make it a carousel instead of making it vertical down which would take up too much space
